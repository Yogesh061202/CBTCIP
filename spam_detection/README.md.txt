# Spam Email Detection using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project implements a machine learning model to classify emails as spam or not spam (ham). It uses natural language processing techniques and a supervised learning approach to train a classifier on a labeled dataset of emails.

## Dataset
The project uses [specify dataset name, e.g., "the Enron-Spam dataset"] which contains [number] emails, labeled as spam or ham. The dataset is not included in this repository due to size constraints but can be downloaded from [provide link or instructions].

## Model Details
The spam detection model uses [specify algorithm, e.g., "Naive Bayes" or "Support Vector Machine"] for classification. Features are extracted from the email text using [mention techniques, e.g., "TF-IDF vectorization"].

Key steps in the pipeline:
1. Text cleaning (removing HTML tags, lowercasing, etc.)
2. Tokenization
3. Feature extraction
4. Model training and evaluation

## Performance
The model achieves the following performance on the test set:
- Accuracy: [X]%
- Precision: [X]%
- Recall: [X]%
- F1 Score: [X]

## Future Improvements
- Implement more advanced NLP techniques like word embeddings
- Experiment with deep learning models (e.g., LSTM, BERT)
- Expand the dataset to improve generalization
- Implement real-time email classification as a service
